# dotfiles

Before doing anything, make sure you know what are you doing! Settings applied by this repository are very personal and definitely not for everyone. I suggest to create your own set of dotfiles based on this repo.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the macOS software is up to date:

```
sudo softwareupdate -i -a --restart
```

Install Apple XCode command line tools:

```
xcode-select --install
```

## Usage

1. Install brew and stuff.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwchiang/dotfiles/master/setup-brew.sh)" 
```
